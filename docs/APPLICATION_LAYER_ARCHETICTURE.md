### Local-GPT-Pilot Workflow

**Local-GPT-Pilot** is designed to expedite the development process based on textual descriptions of features (similar to Jira tickets). The entire process unfolds as follows:

1. **Text Input:**
   - Input, potentially imported from Jira.

2. **Spec Writer Agent:**
   - Generates a detailed prompt for the Architect Agent, converting human language into prompt language.

3. **Architect Agent:**
   - Identifies project/module dependencies and drafts a high-level architecture for the Team Lead Agent.

4. **Team Lead Agent:**
   - Decomposes the provided architecture into actionable tickets and smaller steps for the Implementation Agent.

5. **Pre-Implementation Agent:**
   - Takes the tickets and defines the scope of work for each step, ensuring compatibility of implementations (managing conflicts).
   - Utilizes project structure and method signatures to determine the directories and files where the Implementation Agent will operate.
   - Provides instructions for the Implementation Agent on how and where to implement. This includes handling code in both existing and new files. If an existing method requires modification, its code should be included in the prompt for the Implementation Agent.

6. **Implementation Agent:**
   - Implements the tasks using outputs from the Team Lead and Pre-Implementation Agents.
   - Produces a strict output format including names of files (relative to the project root) and the code implemented.
   - Ensures prompts and contexts are saved for each task.

7. **Script Operations:**
   - Applies changes in a new git branch. If conflicts arise, they are resolved by a human.
   - Optionally, an integration script pushes changes, opens a Merge/Pull Request (MR/PR), addresses comments, and requests fixes from the Implementation Agent as needed.

**Logging and Approval:**
   - All outputs are logged into a UI plugin and require human approval before proceeding to the next stage.


### Scalable Architecture for Local-GPT-Pilot Application

The Local-GPT-Pilot application is architected to facilitate the integration and operation of multiple AI agents, each performing distinct roles within the software development lifecycle. The system supports scalability and customization through the use of open-source, pre-trained AI models running in a local cluster environment. Here’s a detailed architecture outline:

#### System Components:

1. **Cluster Infrastructure:**
   - Utilize Kubernetes to manage a cluster of nodes that can dynamically scale according to the computational demand of the AI agents.
   - Each AI agent runs in a separate, containerized environment to ensure isolation and manage dependencies efficiently.

2. **AI Agents:**
   - Distributed approach: Each agent (Spec Writer, Architect, Team Lead, Pre-Implementation, Implementation) is implemented as a microservice that communicates via REST APIs or message queues (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous processing.
   - Local Development: Each agent is implemented as a set of contexts, prompts and pre-prompts, that are stored in dedicated databases. All the agents uses the same model

3. **Model Management:**
   - A central model repository where open-source pre-trained models are stored and versioned.
   - Users can select a preferred model for each agent via a UI or API call.
   - Supports custom model integration by allowing users to upload their adapter code along with the model.

4. **Data Storage:**
   - Utilizes distributed databases (e.g., MongoDB or Postgres for document storage) to store project files, model outputs, and logs.

5. **User Interface (UI):**
   - A web-based UI that connects to the backend via APIs.
   - Provides functionalities to configure models, initiate processes, and review logs and outputs.
   - Implements approval workflows where users can verify and approve actions before they are passed to the next stage.

6. **DevOps Automation:**
   - Automated scripts for deploying updates to the git repository, handling merge requests, and managing deployment pipelines.
   - Integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins for automating the build and deployment processes.

#### Customization and Scalability:

- **Model Adapter Interface:**
  - Define a standard interface for model adapters that allows integration of any custom model that conforms to the expected input/output specifications.
  - Provide documentation and templates for writing custom adapters.

- **Scalability:**
  - Leverage Kubernetes’ auto-scaling capabilities to manage the load dynamically.
  - Ensure that the system can handle an increasing number of parallel operations as more agents are added or as the complexity of tasks increases.

#### Recommended Open-Source Models:

- **For Natural Language Understanding and Generation:**
  - BERT, GPT (various versions), and Transformer-based architectures suitable for understanding and generating human-like text.

- **For Task Management and Workflow Automation:**
  - Use rule-based systems or simpler ML models for structured task decomposition and workflow management.

This architecture provides a robust foundation for developing a scalable, flexible, and efficient AI-driven development environment. It ensures that new models can be integrated with minimal effort, allowing the system to adapt to new requirements and technologies as they emerge.
