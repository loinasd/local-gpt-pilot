Suggestions for overall repo experience:
- add issues to repo
- closed fork (new closed repository)

Suggestions for the project:
- finetuning on repo(LLM Index for repository? Drawback: fuzzy answers, no idempotency)
- KAN NN for repo finetuning (In the distant future..)
- LSP repo description (for code amending and insertion in file structure)

Notes:
- Input context size is big (130k in Llama 3), output context size is 8k tokens.
- Task Manager (tracker) for internal work of agents. External API for Task Manager (youtrack, jira, etc.) keeps the ability to debug and track the work of agents.
